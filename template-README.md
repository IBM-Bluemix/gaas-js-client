# What is this?

This is a JavaScript SDK for the
[Globalization Pipeline](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/Globalization/index.html#globalization)
Bluemix service. The Globalization Pipeline service makes it easy for you to provide your global customers
with Bluemix applications translated into the languages in which they work.

The SDK currently supports Node.js.

<!-- and also provides some sample code showing
how to use the service from jQuery.

# jQuery Sample

There is an experimental sample showing use of the use in the `jquery-sample` directory.
See the [Readme](./jquery-sample/README.md) in that directory for more details.

-->

# Node.js

The remainder of this document explains how to use the Globalization service
with the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) client.

For a working Bluemix application sample,
see [gp-nodejs-sample](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/gp-nodejs-sample).

## Quickstart - Bluemix

Add `g11n-pipeline` to your project, as well as `cfenv`.

    npm install --save g11n-pipeline cfenv

Load the gaas client object as follows (using [cfenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cfenv) ).

CSve
    var gpClient = require('g11n-pipeline').getClient({
       appEnv: appEnv
    });
    
## Using

To fetch the strings for a bundle named "hello", first create a bundle accessor:

    var mybundle = gpClient.bundle('hello');

Then, call the `getStrings` function with a callback:

    mybundle.getStrings({ languageId: 'es'}, function (err, result) {
        if (err) {
            // handle err..
            console.error(err);
        } else {
            var myStrings = result.resourceStrings;
            console.dir(myStrings);
        }
    });

This code snippet will output the translated strings such as the following:

    {
        hello:   '¡Hola!',
        goodbye: '¡Adiós!',
        …
    }

## Testing

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)

API convention
==

APIs take a callback and use this general pattern:

    gpClient.function( { /*params*/ } ,  function callback(err, ...))

* params: an object containing input parameters, if needed.
* `err`: if truthy, indicates an error has occured.
* `...`: other parameters (optional)

These APIs may be promisified easily using a library such as `Q`'s
[nfcall](http://documentup.com/kriskowal/q/#adapting-node):

    return Q.ninvoke(bundle, "delete", {});
    return Q.ninvoke(gpClient, "getBundleList", {});

Also, note that there are aliases from the swagger doc function names
to the convenience name. For example, `bundle.uploadResourceStrings` can be 
used in place of `bundle.uploadStrings`.

All language identifiers are [IETF BCP47](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) codes.
