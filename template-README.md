# What is this?

This is a JavaScript client and sample code for the
[IBM Globalization](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/Globalization/index.html#globalization)
Bluemix service.

# Node.js

Presently, the client is only available for [node.js](http://nodejs.org) client, but is expected to
support other JavaScript platforms, including browser frameworks.


## Quickstart - Bluemix

Load the gaas client object as follows (using [cfenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cfenv) )

    var appEnv = require('cfenv').getAppEnv();
    var gaasClient = require('gaas').getClient({
        credentials:  appEnv.getService('IBM Globalization').credentials
    });

Or, if you are providing credentials manually:

    var gaas = require('gaas').getClient({ credentials:
        { uri: 'https://<GaaS server URL>', api_key: '<your API key>' }
    });

Note that `api_key` can be from the bound service credentials, or else a "reader key" as
visible in the IBM Globalization service dashboard.

Using APIs
==

Many of the APIs have this pattern:

`obj.function( { /*params*/ } ,  function callback(err, ...))`

* `err`: if truthy, indicates an error has occured.
* `...`: other parameters (optionally)

All language ids are IETF BCP47 codes.
