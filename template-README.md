# WORK IN PROGRESS

This code is being updated for the "Beta" (v2 API) version.
It will very shortly not function with the "Experimental" (v1 API) version.

Much of the text will need to be updated.

# What is this?

This is a JavaScript client and sample code for the
IBM [Globalization Pipeline](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/Globalization/index.html#globalization)
Bluemix service. The Globalization Pipeline service makes it easy for you to provide your global customers
with Bluemix applications translated into the languages in which they work.

Using the client code in this project, either from node.js, or from any browser using the jQuery sample
code, your application can dynamically request translations of your application content
from the IBM Globalization service.

# jQuery Sample

There is an experimental sample showing use of the use in the `jquery-sample` directory.
See the [Readme](./jquery-sample/README.md) in that directory for more details.

# Node.js

The rest of this document explains how to use the Globalization service
with the [node.js](http://nodejs.org) client.

For a working Bluemix application sample,
see [gaas-nodejs-hello](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/gaas-nodejs-hello).

## Quickstart - Bluemix

Add `gaas` to your project, as well as `cfenv`.

    npm install --save gaas cfenv

Load the gaas client object as follows (using [cfenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cfenv) ).
Note that `/IBM Globalization.*/` will match any service *named* with something starting
with `IBM Globalization` (the default). 

    var appEnv = require('cfenv').getAppEnv();
    var gaasClient = require('gaas').getClient({
       credentials:  appEnv.getService(/IBM Globalization.*/).credentials
    });

Or, if you are providing credentials manually:

    var gaasClient = require('gaas').getClient({
     credentials: {
        uri: 'https://<GaaS server URL>',
        api_key: '<your API key>'
     }
    });

Note that `api_key` can be from the bound service credentials, or else a "reader key" as
visible in the IBM Globalization service dashboard.

To load the key "hello" in Spanish from the project named "world" you can use this code:

    var myProject = gaasClient.project('world');

    myProject.getResourceEntry({
          resKey: 'hello',
          languageID: 'es'
        },
        function(err, entry) {
            if(err) {
                console.error(err); return;
            } else if(entry.value) {
                console.log( entry.value ); // Print out the value!
            } else {
                console.error('Status is ' + entry.translationStatus); // may be: 'inProgress' or 'failed'
            }
    });


API convention
==

APIs return promises, unless a callback is provided.

NOTE: The non-promise API is deprecated and will be removed before Beta (as soon
as the test code can be removed)

APIs which take a callback use this pattern:

`obj.function( { /*params*/ } ,  function callback(err, ...))`

* params: an object containing input parameters, if needed.
* `err`: if truthy, indicates an error has occured.
* `...`: other parameters (optionally)

All language identifiers are [IETF BCP47](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) codes.
