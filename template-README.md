# What is this?

This is a JavaScript client and sample code for the
[IBM Globalization](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/Globalization/index.html#globalization)
Bluemix service. The IBM Globalization service makes it easy for you to provide your global customers
with Bluemix applications translated into the languages in which they work.

Using the client code in this project, either from node.js, or from any browser using the jQuery sample
code, your application can dynamically request translations of your application content
from the IBM Globalization service.

# jQuery Sample

There is an experimental sample showing use of the use in the `jquery-sample` directory.
See the [Readme](./jquery-sample/README.md) in that directory for more details.

# Node.js

The rest of this document explains how to use the Globalization service
with the [node.js](http://nodejs.org) client.

## Quickstart - Bluemix

Load the gaas client object as follows (using [cfenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cfenv) ).
Note that `/IBM Globalization.*/` will match any service *named* with something starting
with `IBM Globalization` (the default). 

    var appEnv = require('cfenv').getAppEnv();
    var gaasClient = require('gaas').getClient({
       credentials:  appEnv.getService(/IBM Globalization.*/).credentials
    });

Or, if you are providing credentials manually:

    var gaasClient = require('gaas').getClient({
     credentials: {
        uri: 'https://<GaaS server URL>',
        api_key: '<your API key>'
     }
    });

Note that `api_key` can be from the bound service credentials, or else a "reader key" as
visible in the IBM Globalization service dashboard.

To load the key "hello" in Spanish from the project named "world" you can use this code:

    var myProject = gaasClient.project('world');

    myProject.getResourceEntry({
          resKey: 'hello',
          languageID: 'es'
        },
        function(err, entry) {
            if(err) {
                console.error(err); return;
            } else if(entry.value) {
                console.log( entry.value ); // Print out the value!
            } else {
                console.error('Status is ' + entry.translationStatus); // may be: 'inProgress' or 'failed'
            }
    });


API convention
==

APIs which take a callback use this pattern:

`obj.function( { /*params*/ } ,  function callback(err, ...))`

* params: an object containing input parameters, if needed.
* `err`: if truthy, indicates an error has occured.
* `...`: other parameters (optionally)

All language identifiers are [IETF BCP47](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) codes.
