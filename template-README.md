# What is this?

This is a JavaScript client and sample code for the
[IBM Globalization](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/Globalization/index.html#globalization)
Bluemix service.

# Node.js

Presently, the client is only available for [node.js](http://nodejs.org) client, but is expected to
support other JavaScript platforms, including browser frameworks.


## Node.js - using within Bluemix

Load the gaas client object as follows (using [cfenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cfenv) )

    var appEnv = require('cfenv').getAppEnv();
    var gaasClient = require('gaas').getClient({ credentials:
        appEnv.getService('IBM Globalization')});

Or, if you are providing credentials manually:

    var gaas = require('gaas').getClient({ credentials:
        { uri: 'https://<GaaS server URL>', api_key: '<your API key>' }
    });

Note that `api_key` can be from the bound service credentials, or else a "reader key" as
visible in the IBM Globalization service dashboard.
    

Initializing the client
==

Create the client object as below. The project can be set in the client object
to set a default project name for operations.


    var gaas = require('gaas')({
     url: 'https://<address of GaaS server>/translate',
     api: '<your API key>',
     project: '<your default project name>',
    });

If you have a service bound as the name `IBM Globalization`,
you can use this to fetch credentials from VCAP:

``` js
var gaas = require('gaas');
var gaasClient = gaas.getClient({ vcap: process.env.VCAP_SERVICES, project: 'MyProject'});
```

Using APIs
==

Many of the APIs have this pattern:

`obj.function( { /*params*/ } ,  function callback(err, results...))`

* `err`, if truthy, indicates an error has occured.
* Usually `results` is a single object.

All language ids are IETF BCP47 codes.
