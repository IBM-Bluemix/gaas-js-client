# What is this?

This is a JavaScript SDK for the
[Globalization Pipeline](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/Globalization/index.html#globalization)
Bluemix service. The Globalization Pipeline service makes it easy for you to provide your global customers
with Bluemix applications translated into the languages in which they work.

The SDK currently supports Node.js, and also provides some sample code showing
how to use the service from jQuery.

# jQuery Sample

There is an experimental sample showing use of the use in the `jquery-sample` directory.
See the [Readme](./jquery-sample/README.md) in that directory for more details.

# Node.js

The remainder of this document explains how to use the Globalization service
with the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) client.

For a working Bluemix application sample,
see [g11n-pipeline-nodejs-hello](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/g11n-pipeline-nodejs-hello).

## Quickstart - Bluemix

Add `g11n-pipeline` to your project, as well as `cfenv`.

    npm install --save g11n-pipeline cfenv

Load the gaas client object as follows (using [cfenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cfenv) ).

    var appEnv = require('cfenv').getAppEnv();
    var gaasClient = require('gaas').getClient({
       credentials:  appEnv.getService(/IBM Globalization.*/).credentials
    });


//// gp-* OR g11n-pipeline*


# BELOW IS WORK IN PROGRESS

# HOW TO USE THIS TO TEST GAAS-SERVICES (rest)

* create `local-test.properties` with the following lines:

    # Set the admin ID and password as appropriate
    GAAS_ADMIN_ID=......
    GAAS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=......
    # the server URL to use. Adjust to taste. Include trailing slash.
    GAAS_API_URL=http://localhost:9080/translate
    
* install [node](http://nodejs.org)
* `npm install`
* `npm test`


# OTHER CONFIG OPTIONS

    # set this if AUTHENTICATION_SCHEME=BASIC is set on the server
    # assumes that Admins can login with HTTP Basic
    AUTHENTICATION_SCHEME=BASIC
    
    # set this to skip the 'REST' test
    NO_REST_TEST=true
    
    # set this to skip the 'Client' test
    NO_CLIENT_TEST=true
    
    # set this for extra verbosity
    GAAS_VERBOSE=true
    
    # set this to NOT delete the bundle in the client test at the end
    NO_DELETE=true



API convention
==

APIs return promises, unless a callback is provided.

NOTE: The non-promise API is deprecated and will be removed before Beta (as soon
as the test code can be removed)

APIs which take a callback use this pattern:

`obj.function( { /*params*/ } ,  function callback(err, ...))`

* params: an object containing input parameters, if needed.
* `err`: if truthy, indicates an error has occured.
* `...`: other parameters (optionally)

All language identifiers are [IETF BCP47](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) codes.
